    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
      <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the meat:</b> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned
        and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent.
        Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil,
        1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until
        they're al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe
        (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is
        assembled.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for
        about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is
        golden brown.
